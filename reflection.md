- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My take away from how association affects my program is that before coding i should stablish the relationships because i have to reference the methods and objects . It was really useful having an order to what class to create first which i will continue to do. I would recommend for any person taking the class that they should list out what methods because it gets confusing because of all the references
